Due to life events I gave up on this project. The basic premis was to create wizards that would jump start wso2 development based on standard patterns and desired behaviors.


# SpeedyESB
## Streamline Most Common WSO2 ESB Project Types.

## This will suppor the creation of:
  * [TODO] Maven Multi Project, CAR, ESB, Registry, and other WSO2 ESB Project types
  
## ESB project patterns of:
### ASync - "Full speed ESB" - Using Message Store/Message Processor/Reply Sequence
  * [TODO] Store and Forward with simple instant Acknowlege 
  * [TODO] Store and Forward with delayed Retrieve/Acknowlege Return

### Sync - "I'll wait for the result"
  * [TODO] Store, Retrieve, Acknowlege Return
